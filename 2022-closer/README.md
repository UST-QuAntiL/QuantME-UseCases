# CLOSER 2022 Prototype

This use case shows how to model quantum workflows independently of a certain hybrid runtime, analyze them to find workflow fragments that can benefit from a certain runtime, and rewrite the workflow to use these runtimes.
In the following, we focus on so-called *hybrid runtimes*, such as the [Qiskit Runtime](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iql/runtime/).
They can be used to upload quantum and classical programs comprising a hybrid quantum algorithm together as *hybrid program*.
Thus, the programs are provisioned close together, and their communication is optimized, which improves the performance of hybrid quantum algorithms performing multiple iterations of quantum and classical processing.

In the following sections, we present the analysis and rewrite method based on the workflow model shown below:

![Exemplary Quantum Workflow](./docs/exemplary-quantum-workflow.png)

First, [pre-processed data](./data/embedding.txt) is loaded, which is used to initialize a quantum k-means algorithm.
Then, the workflow enters a hybrid loop, executing quantum circuits, calculating new centroids based on the results, and adapting the quantum circuits if needed for the next iteration.
This loop ends when the clustering converges, i.e., the difference between the new and old centroids is smaller than a given threshold or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
Next, a variational support vector machine is trained.
This is done using another hybrid loop, optimizing the parameters theta until the incurred costs are smaller than 0.2 or the limit of 30 iterations is reached.
Finally, the variational support vector machine is evaluated by classifying test data, and the resulting figure is displayed to the user in the last user task.

In case you experience any problems during modeling, rewrite, deployment, or execution of the workflow, please refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section at the end of this README.

## Setting up the MODULO Framework

First, we will discuss the steps required to set up the different components comprising the MODULO framework.
All components except the [QuantME Transformation Framework](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-TransformationFramework) providing the graphical BPMN modeler are available via Docker.
Therefore, these components can be started using the Docker-Compose file available [here](./docker):

1. Update the [.env](./docker/.env) file with your settings: 
  * ``PUBLIC_HOSTNAME``: Enter the hostname/IP address of your Docker engine. Do *not* use ``localhost``.

2. Run the Docker-Compose file:
```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Wait until all containers are up and running. This may take some minutes.

To start the QuantME Transformation Framework, please execute the following steps:

1. Clone the repository using release v1.4.0: 
```
git clone https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-TransformationFramework.git --branch v1.4.0
```

2. Move to the cloned folder and build the framework:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

3. The build product can be found in the ``dist`` folder and started depending on the operating system, e.g., using the ``.exe`` for Windows.

Afterwards, the following screen should be displayed:

![QuantME Transformation Framework](./docs/modeler-after-build.png)

Open the example workflow model available [here](./workflow/analysis-and-rewrite-workflow.bpmn) using the QuantME Transformation Framework.
For this, click on ``File`` in the top-left corner, and afterwards, select the workflow model in the dialogue ``Open File...``.
Then, the following screen is displayed:

![Quantum Workflow in Modeler](./docs/quantum-workflow-in-modeler.png)

The QuantME Transformation Framework must be configured with the endpoints of the services for the deployment and the hybrid program generation.
For this, click on ``Configuration`` in the toolbar, opening the config pop-up:

![Quantum Workflow in Modeler](./docs/modeler-configuration.png)

Please update the different configuration properties using the following values. 
Thereby, $IP has to be replaced with the IP-address of the Docker engine used for the setup described above:

* ``BPMN`` tab:
    * ``Camunda Engine Endpoint``: http://$IP:8080/engine-rest
* ``OpenTOSCA`` tab:
    * ``OpenTOSCA Endpoint``: http://$IP:1337/csars
    * ``Winery Endpoint``: http://$IP:8093/winery
* ``QRM Data`` tab:
    * ``QRM Repository User``: UST-QuAntiL
    * ``QRM Repository Name``: QuantME-UseCases
    * ``QRM Repository Path``: 2022-closer/qrms
* ``Hybrid Runtimes`` tab:
    * ``Qiskit Runtime Handler Endpoint``: http://$IP:8889

In case you want to execute the workflow model without optimization, press the ``Transformation`` Button in the toolbar on the top to retrieve a standard-compliant BPMN workflow model.
Then, directly go to the [Deploying the Required Services](#deploying-the-required-services) section.
However, do *not* perform the transformation if you want to optimize the workflow, as this has to be done before the transformation step.

## Analysis and Rewrite of Quantum Workflows

To trigger the workflow analysis and rewrite, click on the ``Improve Hybrid Loops`` button on the top.
Then, the following modal is displayed, comprising some information about the analysis and rewrite method:

![Hybrid Loop Detection Modal](./docs/hybrid-loop-detection-modal.png)

Press the ``Analyse Workflow`` button to start the detection of hybrid loops within the workflow, which could benefit from a hybrid runtime.
When the analysis finishes, the possible optimization candidates are visualized in the next modal:

![Workflow Rewrite Modal Candidate 1](./docs/workflow-rewrite-modal-1.png)

In our example workflow, two optimization candidates are detected, one performing the clustering, and the second comprising the classification tasks.
The tabs on the top of the modal can be used to switch between the visualization of all detected optimization candidates:

![Workflow Rewrite Modal Candidate 2](./docs/workflow-rewrite-modal-2.png)

Furthermore, a list of supported hybrid runtimes is displayed in the table below.
Currently, only the Qiskit Runtime is supported.
Click on the ``Rewrite Workflow`` button to analyze if the selected hybrid runtime supports the current candidate.
If yes, a hybrid program, as well as a corresponding deployment model, are automatically generated for the candidate.
Finally, the workflow is rewritten to invoke the generated hybrid program.
After clicking on the button, the following screen is displayed until the analysis and rewrite terminates, which might take some time:

![Workflow Rewrite In Progress](./docs/workflow-rewrite-in-progress.png)

If the rewriting is successful, the color of the button is changed to green and the workflow is adapted in the background, as shown in the next figure:

![Workflow Rewrite Successful](./docs/workflow-rewrite-successful.png)

Start the rewriting also for the other candidate, and wait until it completes.
Then, close the modal, which shows the rewritten workflow model within the modeler:

![Workflow After Rewrite](./docs/workflow-after-rewriting.png)

The resulting workflow contains five service tasks.
Thereby, three service tasks were not part of an optimization candidate and are unchanged.
In contrast, all remaining tasks contained in the hybrid loops are replaced by two new service tasks invoking the corresponding hybrid programs.

## Deploying the Required Services

Next, the required services for the workflow execution can be deployed.
For this, click on the ``Service Deployment`` button in the toolbar:

![Service Deployment Overview](./docs/service-deployment-overview.png)

The pop-up lists the IDs of all service tasks to which deployment models are attached, the name of the CSAR representing the deployment model, and the binding type of the service to deploy.
All required services are deployed using the [OpenTOSCA Container](https://github.com/OpenTOSCA/container), a TOSCA-compliant deployment system.
To trigger the upload of the CSARs to the OpenTOSCA Container, press the ``Upload CSARs`` button.
The OpenTOSCA Container automatically generates a deployment plan for the different services, and analyzes if additional input data has to be requested from the user.
Once the upload is finished, the required input parameters are displayed on the following screen:

![Service Deployment Create Instances](./docs/service-deployment-overview-create-instances.png)

All services for this use case are deployed as Docker containers in a local [Docker-in-Docker (dind)](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind) container.
Thus, no additional input parameters are required for these services.
However, the hybrid programs must be uploaded to Qiskit Runtime, and for this upload, an IBMQ access token is required, which can be retrieved from the [IBM Quantum Experience website](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).
For this use case, we deploy both hybrid programs for the same IBMQ user, and thus, use the same token.
After adding the token, click on the ``Deploy Services`` button, and wait until the deployment finishes. Afterwards, the screen below is shown:

![Service Deployment Binding](./docs/service-deployment-binding.png)

In the last step of the service deployment, the newly created service instances are bound to the workflow.
For this, click on the ``Perform Binding`` button.

Finally, the workflow model can be deployed to the [Camunda BPMN engine](https://camunda.com/products/camunda-platform/bpmn-engine/), by clicking on the ``Workflow Deployment`` button in the toolbar:

![Workflow Deployment](./docs/workflow-deployment.png)

## Executing the Quantum Workflow

After successfully deploying all required services and the workflow model, open the URL of the Camunda BPMN engine: ``$PUBLIC_HOSTNAME:8080/camunda``

First, create an account in the Camunda engine and log in. 
Then, the following screen is displayed:

![Camunda Overview](./docs/camunda-overview.png)

Switch to the Camunda cockpit application by clicking on the top-right and selecting ``Cockpit``:

![Camunda Cockpit](./docs/camunda-cockpit.png)

If the workflow model was successfully deployed in the [deployment step](#deploying-the-required-services), a 1 should be displayed under the ``Process Definitions`` label. 
Click on ``Processes`` on the top to get a list of all deployed workflow models:

![Camunda Cockpit Workflow Overview](./docs/camunda-cockpit-workflow-models.png)

Select the previously modeled and deployed workflow model by clicking on its name, which opens a view where the workflow model is shown. 
In this view, the token flow can be observed during workflow execution, i.e., it is visualized which activity of the workflow model is currently executed. 
Furthermore, the current values of the different variables in the workflow are displayed. 
To execute the workflow, open another tab with the Camunda tasklist application by clicking on the top-right and selecting ``Tasklist``:

![Camunda Tasklist](./docs/camunda-tasklist.png)

To instantiate the workflow model, select ``Start process`` on the top-right and click on the name of the workflow in the pop-up menu. 
Next, the required input parameters for the instantiation are shown, which were defined in the start event form of the workflow:

![Camunda Tasklist Input](./docs/camunda-tasklist-input.png)

Provide your IBMQ access token, as well as one of the QPUs available over IBMQ (``ibmq_lima`` in the example) as input parameters.
Please make sure to provide the same IBMQ access token as used for the deployment of the hybrid programs, as they are deployed in private mode and are only visible to the user to which the token belongs. 
Furthermore, the URL to the input data has to be passed as a parameter.
Thereby, the [pre-processed data](./data/embedding.txt) is available in this repository, and thus, the following URL can be used: ``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases/master/2022-closer/data/embedding.txt``

After entering the input parameters, click on ``Start``.
The UI displays a notification at the bottom-right that the workflow instance was successfully started.
Switch back to the Camunda cockpit application to observe the token flow in the workflow:

![Camunda Token Flow](./docs/camunda-cockpit-running-workflow.png)

Click on the corresponding workflow instance at the bottom, to view more details, such as the current values of the variables:

![Camunda Instance View](./docs/camunda-cockpit-instance-view.png)

When the token reaches one of the two service tasks invocing hybrid programs, their execution can be monitored in the [IBMQ](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) UI:

![Qiskit Runtime Queued](./docs/qiskit-runtime-queued.png)

Furthermore, more details can be displayed when clicking on the queued job:

![Qiskit Runtime Details](./docs/qiskit-runtime-job-details.png)

Once the job finishes, the output parameters are also presented in the UI:

![Qiskit Runtime Output](./docs/qiskit-runtime-job-details-ready.png)

Switch back to the Camunda cockpit and wait until the token reaches the final user task in the workflow as depicted below.
For this, refresh the page to see the current state of the workflow instance.
This might take some time, depending on the utilization of the selected QPU.

![User Task Reached](./docs/camunda-cockpit-human-task.png)

Afterward, switch to the Camunda tasklist and click on ``Add a simple filter`` on the left.
Now, the task object for the human task should be visible in the task list.
Click on the task object and then on the ``Claim`` button to get the URL for the plot of the boundary definition resulting from the evaluation of the trained classifier:

![Camunda Tasklist Result](./docs/camunda-tasklist-result.png)

After analyzing the result, click on the ``Complete`` button to finish the human task, and as it is the last activity in the workflow to terminate the workflow instance.

To terminate the environment, execute the following command in the [folder](./docker) with the Docker-Compose file: ``docker-compose down -v``
Furthermore, you can delete the uploaded hybrid programs either using Qiskit and the ``IBMRuntimeService.delete_program()`` method (see [here](https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/qiskit-runtime/blob/main/tutorials/02_uploading_program.ipynb)) or the [Qiskit Runtime API](https://runtime-us-east.quantum-computing.ibm.com/openapi/#/).

## Troubleshooting

Qiskit Runtime is currently [based on the latest Qiskit version](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iql/runtime/start).
This means, also the generated hybrid programs must be compatible with the latest Qiskit version.
As the hybrid programs are generated from the quantum and classical programs, their used Qiskit version influences the Qiskit version of the hybrid programs.
Thus, the generated hybrid programs might fail if there are breaking changes in newer Qiskit versions.
The provided programs are based on version 0.33.1, please visit the [Qiskit release page](https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html) in case you experience any problems, and check for possible changes.

The setup starts overall 9 Docker containers, and the required services are deployed within one of these containers using so-called [Docker-in-Docker (dind)](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind).
Thus, if the startup of the Docker-Compose file or the deployment of the services fails, please make sure to provide enough resources to the docker engine, i.e., CPU, main memory, and disk space.
